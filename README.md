## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. 🧠 **Personal Knowledge Base** —  
   Designed first and foremost as a tool for myself, to:
	<br>A. "gather "
	<br>B. retain
	<br>C. review, 
	<br>D. and quickly reference 
	<br>the key concepts, tools, and approaches I’ve studied in Business Analysis.

3. 🧑‍🎓 **For Beginners & Career Changers** —  
   A clear and beginner-friendly entry point into the world of analytics — with progressive organization, hands-on notes, and real-world relevance.

4. 👥 **For Practicing Analysts** —  
   A fast, structured way to revisit essential topics, methods, and deliverables, without diving into long textbooks or scattered resources.
 
5. 🗂️ **For those who wants to quickly check my Learning Path** —

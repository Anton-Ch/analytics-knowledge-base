# [Analytics MOC](.md)

## Just a reminder
My current **focus is Business Analysis**, due to my current full time *role*. 
That is why so far here is only:

[Business Analytics MOC](Business%20Analytics/Business%20Analytics%20MOC.md) - the note to navigate in Business Analysis topics

However in the future this structure will allow natural expansion into:
- System Analysis
- Data Analysis
â€¦if and when such topics become part of my learning journey.

[Analytics Abbreviations and Terms](Analytics%20Abbreviations%20and%20Terms.md) - list of all shortenings and acronyms used in this knowledge base. If you find any abbreviation which seems unclear just chek this list for explanation.

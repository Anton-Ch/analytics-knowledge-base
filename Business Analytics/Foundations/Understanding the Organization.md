# 🧭 Understanding the Organization

> *Why understanding the company’s structure, culture, goals, and internal dynamics is a critical step in solving any business problem.*

## 🧠 Why Context Matters

Before addressing a business problem (e.g., sales decline, workflow inefficiency), a Business Analyst must understand **where the problem lives**:

- What are the company’s values and goals?
- How is it structured?
- What constraints and dynamics shape behavior?
- What unspoken rules are in play?

Without this context, even the best-intentioned solutions can miss the mark.

## 🗺️ Organizational Landscape: What to Analyze

### 1. 🎯 Mission & Vision Statements
- Reflect the company’s **purpose** and **aspirations**
- Help align your analysis with long-term goals

> *"Think of them as the compass guiding all actions."*

---

### 2. 📊 Strategic Plans
- Outline company-wide initiatives and targets
- Reveal what leadership prioritizes
- Help align your proposals with strategy

---

### 3. 🧭 Organizational Charts
- Show hierarchy and reporting lines
- Help identify key decision-makers and influencers
- Clarify departments involved in the problem space

---

### 4. 📄 Policies & Procedures
- Define how work should be done
- Help you avoid suggesting solutions that violate internal rules
- Example: remote work, data security, or approval processes

---

### 5. 💸 Financial Reports
- Offer insight into revenue streams, spending, and priorities
- Useful for detecting root causes (e.g., cash flow pressures)
- Help tailor feasible solutions

---

### 6. 🛠️ Service Blueprints
- Visualize customer journey and behind-the-scenes systems
- Show touchpoints, gaps, and inefficiencies
- Reveal hidden dependencies between processes and teams

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Understanding Organizational Culture

Culture is the **invisible force** shaping behavior and communication. To assess it:

### 🔍 Observe:
- Office dynamics
- Leadership communication style
- Team interactions
- Informal norms (coffee chats, team rituals)

### 🗣 Ask:
- Open-ended questions about values, frustrations, and dynamics
- What motivates and demoralizes teams?

### 🌐 Research:
- Glassdoor, The Muse, Indeed
- Internal surveys and feedback loops

> *“Don’t believe only what people say — observe what they do.”*

## 🧪 Example: Misdiagnosed Sales Problem

Imagine you’re asked to improve sales figures.  
A generic approach (e.g., more training, incentives) fails.  
Only after understanding the company do you find:

- Sales team is micromanaged
- Leadership is under pressure from cash flow issues
- Morale is low due to decision opacity

📌 **Real issue:** culture, communication, and leadership — not individual skills.

# 🕵️ Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

> *A structured technique used to uncover the underlying causes of problems — not just the visible symptoms.*

## 🧭 What Is RCA?

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is a systematic process for identifying the fundamental reason why a problem occurs.  
Rather than addressing symptoms or surface issues, RCA **“peels back the layers”** to reveal the core problem that, if resolved, prevents recurrence.

---

## 💡 Why Use RCA?

- Stop treating symptoms — solve the real problem
- Prevent similar issues from reappearing
- Ensure lasting, effective, and sustainable solutions
- Empower cross-functional collaboration and deep understanding

---

## 🔁 RCA Workflow

1. **Clearly define the problem**
2. **Gather data and observations**
3. **Identify contributing factors**
4. **Use techniques (e.g. 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram)**
5. **Pinpoint the root cause**
6. **Validate with data**
7. **Recommend and implement solutions**
8. **Monitor results and adjust as needed**

## 🧪 Case Example: Sales Decline in a Small Company

> *Problem:* Sales were consistently dropping despite marketing, bonuses, and training.  
> Management was perplexed.

**Approach:**  
CEO assembled a cross-functional team (Sales, Marketing, Product, Support)  
→ They applied **Root Cause Analysis** using the **5 Whys** technique.

### 📌 The 5 Whys Chain

1. Why are sales declining?  
→ Customers are buying less.

2. Why are they buying less?  
→ Product quality has declined.

3. Why did quality decline?  
→ Materials changed.

4. Why did materials change?  
→ Prices increased sharply.

5. Why did prices increase?  
→ The company extended supplier payment terms to 90 days.

✅ **Root Cause:** Cash flow changes led to longer payment terms → caused price hikes → caused material downgrade → caused quality decline → caused lower sales.

📈 **Proposed Solution:** Return to previous materials and renegotiate shorter payment terms with discounts → regain product quality → improve customer trust and sales.

- 🔍 RCA helps move **from assumption → analysis**
- 🧠 Collaboration across departments provides full visibility
- 📊 Data replaces guesswork
- ✅ Real root cause enables focused and effective solution
